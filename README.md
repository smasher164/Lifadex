# Lifadex
Lifadex lets you preview, vote, and see statistics on legislation.

It's an acronym for "Legislative Information and Feedback Analysis Index," because I needed a name for the directory.

This project is currently under development/iteration. As such, I'm still trying out lots of different ideas. Feel free to submit an issue if you find something interesting or think of an idea.
